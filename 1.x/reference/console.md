# Console commands

```sh
php bin/console list        # in DDEV: ddev console list
```

## `deploy`

Optimizes the autoloader, rebuilds every cache, publishes post files and refreshes the web
server's Opcache. See [Deploying](../deployment/) for the options and
[Deploy steps](../extending/deploy-steps) for the steps.

```sh
php bin/console deploy [--list-steps] [--skip=a,b] [--assets] [--opcache=cachetool|reload|none]
                       [--fcgi=…] [--cachetool=…] [--reload-cmd=…] [--composer=…] [--no-dev]
                       [--skip-composer] [--skip-opcache]
```

Exit codes: `0` deployed, `1` a step failed, `2` invalid options (nothing was changed).

## `cache:clear`

Deletes everything in `var/cache` (keeping `.gitkeep`) and the post and page files published to
`public/media/blog/` and `public/media/pages/`. If a deploy left the Composer autoloader authoritative, it also runs
`composer dump-autoload`, so new classes are found again. Run it when you go back to development
after a deploy.

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--composer` | `composer` | Composer binary |

## `cdn:purge`

Drops pages from the CDN's cache ([CDN caching](../deployment/cdn)), with the purger set by
`CDN_PURGE` or a package.

```sh
php bin/console cdn:purge blog/my-post /it/chi-siamo        # paths on this site (APP_URL)
php bin/console cdn:purge https://example.com/blog/my-post  # full URLs
php bin/console cdn:purge --all                             # everything
```

Exit codes: `0` purged, `1` the CDN refused or no purge is set up (the message says why), `2` no
URLs and no `--all`, or both.
