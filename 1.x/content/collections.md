# Data collections

Collections hold structured content beyond blog posts: an FAQ, a team, products, a catalogue of
sounds. Like posts, they're plain files in `content/`, checked when they're compiled, translatable,
and compiled into a cache on deploy, so no database is involved.

The skeleton's home page shows one: the FAQ in `content/faq/`.

## Define a collection

Collections are defined in `config/collections.php`, with the fields each item has:

```php
return [
    'faq' => [
        'fields' => [
            'question' => 'string',
            'order' => 'int',
        ],
        'sort' => 'order',
    ],
    'team' => [
        'fields' => [
            'name' => 'string',
            'role' => 'string',
            'photo' => '?url',
            'joined' => 'date',
        ],
        'sort' => '-joined',
        'fallback' => true,
    ],
];
```

Names use lowercase letters, digits and underscores (`collections.team_members` in Twig). `blog`
and `pages` are reserved.

### Field types

| Type | Value | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `string` | non-empty text, trimmed | `name: Ada` |
| `int`, `float` | a number | `order: 2`, `price: 9.5` |
| `bool` | `true` or `false` | `featured: true` |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `joined: 2024-03-01` |
| `url` | a `/path` (a file in `public/`) or an `https://` URL | `photo: /images/ada.webp` |
| `markdown` | Markdown text, rendered to HTML | `bio: Writes *tests*.` |
| `list` | a list of plain values | `tags: [setup, php]` |
| `array` | any YAML structure, unchecked | `links: {site: https://ada.dev}` |

A leading `?` makes a field optional: `'?url'`. A missing optional field is `null`.

### Options

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `sort` | by slug | a field to sort by; `'-field'` for descending. Items without a value come last |
| `fallback` | `false` | `true`: an item without a translation appears in the default language instead of being hidden |
| `json` | none | `true` or a list of fields: serves them at `/data/<name>.json` for JavaScript (below) |

## Add items

Each item is a file in `content/<collection>/`, named after its slug:

```
content/faq/
  what-is-starlite.md       front matter = the fields, then an optional Markdown body
  what-is-starlite.it.md    Italian version
content/team/
  ada.yaml                  fields only
```

A Markdown item:

```md
---
question: What is Starlite?
order: 1
---
A small PHP framework for sites that are mostly content…
```

The body becomes the item's `html`. Links and images in it use `/paths` or full URLs; images go in
`public/`, since collection folders hold only item files.

Every item also has `slug` (from the file name), `language` and `source` (its file, for error
messages). These names can't be used as fields.

## Translations

`<slug>.<language>.md` (or `.yaml`) is the item in another language. Like post translations, it
only needs what changes: any field it omits, and the body if it has none, keep the default-language
value. So a product's Italian file can hold just `name` and the description, while its price comes
from the default file.

An item without a translation is hidden in that language, unless the collection has
`'fallback' => true`. Then it appears in the default language, with `language` set accordingly, so
templates can mark it: `<li lang="{{ item.language }}">`.

## In templates

The `collections` global works in the current language, in the configured order:

```twig
{% for item in collections.faq %}
    <details>
        <summary>{{ item.question }}</summary>
        {{ item.html|raw }}
    </details>
{% endfor %}

{% set ada = collections.team.find('ada') %}
{{ collections.team|length }} people
{% for member in collections.team.where('role', 'Designer') %}…{% endfor %}
```

| Method | |
|---|---|
| `collection.all(language = null)` | every item (a `for` loop does the same) |
| `collection.find(slug, language = null)` | one item, or `null` |
| `collection.where(field, value, language = null)` | items whose field equals the value; for a `list` field, items that contain it |
| `collection\|length` | the number of items |

`item.html` and `markdown` fields are HTML from Markdown with raw HTML escaped, so `|raw` is safe
there.

## In PHP

```php
$team = $this->app->collections['team'];   // or ->get('team')
$ada = $team->find('ada');
```

A page per item is a route of your own:

```php
$app->get('/team/{slug}', [TeamController::class, 'show'], 'team_member', ['slug' => '[a-z0-9-]+']);
```

```php
public function show(string $slug): Response|string
{
    $member = $this->app->collections['team']->find($slug);
    if ($member === null) {
        return $this->notFound();
    }
    $this->app->seo->title($member['name']);

    return $this->render('team/member.twig', ['member' => $member]);
}
```

## JSON for JavaScript

A page module that needs the data (a catalogue to filter, a mixer's sounds) can fetch it. List the
fields to publish:

```php
'sounds' => [
    'fields' => ['name' => 'string', 'file' => 'url', 'notes' => '?string'],
    'json' => ['name', 'file'],
],
```

They're served at `/data/sounds.json` (`/it/data/sounds.json` in Italian), with `slug` and
`language`:

```js
const sounds = await (await fetch(document.body.dataset.soundsUrl)).json();
```

```twig
<body data-sounds-url="{{ path('collection_json', {collection: 'sounds'}) }}">
```

It's an allowlist: fields not listed under `json` are never served, and collections without `json`
have no URL. Responses carry an ETag like pages, so browsers revalidate cheaply.

## Errors

Collections are checked when they're compiled (on every request in development, on deploy in
production), and anything unexpected stops with the file name:

- a field not in the definition, a missing required field, or a value of the wrong type
- a file that isn't `<slug>.md` or `<slug>.yaml`, or a subfolder
- a translation without its default-language file, or for a language that isn't configured
- a folder in `content/` that isn't the blog or a defined collection (usually a typo)
- a relative link in Markdown

Run `ddev composer test`: the skeleton's tests compile the site's real content, so CI catches a
broken file before it's deployed.
